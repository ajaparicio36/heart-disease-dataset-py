# Linear Regression of Heart Disease Risk and Factors

### What is this chart about?

### Questions to Answer

1. Why did you choose this dataset?

Disease can struck suddenly sometimes, but that is just because of negligence. I chose this dataset to inform myself more about the risk
of Heart Disease and what factors can affect it. I strive to be healthy, and information about this doesn't hurt to learn. So answering this
dataset isn't just about for the submission in the exam but also rather a learning, that our bodies are fragile, yet there are many things
we can do to keep it safe. This dataset was generated based on science, so it doesn't just contain some nutty values some guy ripped off
from AI chat bots anyway.

2. What is your conclusion upon conducting linear regression on this dataset?

3. How relevant is linear regression today?
